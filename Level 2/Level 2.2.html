    <p class="one">To a sad girl Uriah Hamilton There is no way to explain Unending sorrow and grief, </p> <br/>
    <p class="two"> No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek In a way that would give her back </p> <br/>
    <p class="three"> The joy death has stolen. Humans are brave enough </p> <br/>
    <p class="four"> To live and bleed </p> <br/>
    <p class="five"> and die, </p> <br/>
    <p class="six"> But </p> <br/>
    <p class="five"> to be </p> <br/>
    <p class="four"> the one remaining </p> <br/>
    <p class="three"> As others say goodbye Is too much to withstand. </p> <br/>
    <p class="two">There are evil stars that smirk And thus mark us for treacherous fates, </p> <br/>
    <p class="one"> The days all burn like desert fields Until there is nothing left to love And nothing left to feel. </p> <br/>
