    <h1>To a sad girl </h1>
    <h2>Uriah Hamilton </h2>
  </div>
   
  <div>
    <h3 class="block-one">
There is no way to explain <br/>
Unending sorrow and grief, <br/>
    </h3>
    <h3 class="block-two">
No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek <br/>
In a way that would give her back <br/>
The joy death has stolen. <br/>
    </h3>
  </div>

  <div>  
  <h4 class="block-three"> 
Humans are brave enough <br/>
To live and bleed and die, <br/> 
  </h4>

  <h4 class="block-four">
But to be the one remaining
As others say goodbye <br/>
Is too much to withstand. <br/>
    </h4>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h5 class="block-five">There are evil stars that smirk <br/>
And thus mark us for treacherous fates, <br/>
    </h5>
    <h5 class="block-six">
The days all burn like desert fields <br/>
Until there is nothing left to love <br/>
And nothing left to feel. <br/>
    </h5>
