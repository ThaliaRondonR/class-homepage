      To a sad girl 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Uriah Hamilton <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no way to explain <br/>
      Unending sorrow and grief, <br/>
      No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek <br/>
      In a way that would give her back <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The joy death has stolen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans are brave enough <br/>
      To live and bleed and die,<br/>
      But to be the one remaining <br/>
      As others say goodbye <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Is too much to withstand. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are evil stars that smirk <br/>
      And thus mark us for treacherous fates, <br/>
      The days all burn like desert fields <br/>
      Until there is nothing left to love <br/>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      And nothing left to feel.
    </p>
