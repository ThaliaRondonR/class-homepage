    <p>To a sad girl <br/>
    Uriah Hamilton
    </p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>There is no way to explain <br/>
Unending sorrow and grief, <br/>
No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek <br/>
In a way that would give her back <br/>
The joy death has stolen. <br/>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>Humans are brave enough <br/>
To live and bleed and die, <br/> 
But to be the one remaining <br/>
As others say goodbye <br/>
Is too much to withstand. <br/>
    </p>
    <br/>

    <p>There are evil stars that smirk <br/>
And thus mark us for treacherous fates, <br/>
The days all burn like desert fields <br/>
Until there is nothing left to love <br/>
And nothing left to feel. <br/>
    </p>
