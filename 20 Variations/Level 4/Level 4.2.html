    <p>
      To a <span class="large-small">sad</span> <span class="small-large">girl</span> <br/>
      <span class="small-large">Uriah</span> Hamilton
    </p>
    
    <p>
      There is no way to explain <br/>
      <span class="large-small">Unending</span> sorrow <span class="small-large">and</span> grief, <br/>
      No way to <span class="small-large">kiss</span> a young girlâ€™s cheek <br/>
      In a way that would give her back <br/>
      The <span class="small-large">joy</span> <span class="large-small">death</span> has stolen. <br/>
    </p>

    <p>Humans are <span class="large-small">brave</span> enough <br/>
To <span class="small-large">live</span> and <span class="small-large">bleed</span> and <span class="small-large">die</span>, <br/> 
But to be  <span class="large-small">the one</span> remaining <br/>
As others say <span class="small-large">goodbye</span> <br/>
Is  <span class="large-small">too much</span> to withstand. <br/>
    </p>

    <p>There are <span class="large-small">evil</span> <span class="small-large">stars</span> that smirk <br/>
And thus mark us for treacherous <span class="large-small">fates</span>, <br/>
The days all <span class="small-large">burn</span> like desert fields <br/>
Until there is <span class="large-small">nothing</span> left to <span class="small-large">love</span> <br/>
And <span class="large-small">nothing left</span> to <span class="small-large">feel</span> <span class="large-small">.</span>
    </p>
