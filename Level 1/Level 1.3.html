    <p> To 
    <p> a sad 
    <p> girl Uriah Hamilton</p>
    <p> There is no way </p>
    <p> to explain Unending sorrow and</p>
    <p> grief, No way to kiss a</p>
    <p> young girlâ€™s cheek In a way that</p> 
    <p> would give her back The joy death has </p>
    <p> stolen. Humans are brave enough To live and bleed</p>
    <p> and die, But to be the one remaining As others</p>
    <p> say goodbye Is too much to withstand. There are evil stars</p>
    <p> that smirk And thus mark us for treacherous fates, The days all</p>
    <p> burn like desert fields Until there is nothing left to love And nothing</p>
    <p class="end">  left <br/>
    to <br/>
  feel. </p>
