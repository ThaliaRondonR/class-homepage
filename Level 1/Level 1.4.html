        To a sad girl &nbsp
        Uriah Hamilton </p>

      <p class="line-one">
        There is no way to explain &nbsp
        Unending sorrow and grief, </p>
      <p class="line-two">
        No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek &nbsp
        In a way that would give her back </p>
      <p class="line-three">
        The joy death has stolen. &nbsp
        Humans are brave enough </p>
      <p class="line-four">
        To live and bleed and die, &nbsp
        But to be the one remaining </p>
      <p class="line-five">
        As others say goodbye &nbsp
        Is too much to withstand. </p>
      <p class="line-six">
        There are evil stars that smirk &nbsp
        And thus mark us for treacherous fates, </p>
      <p class="line-seven">    
        The days all burn like desert fields &nbsp
        Until there is nothing left to love </p>   
      <p class="line-eight">  
        And nothing left to feel. 
      </p>
