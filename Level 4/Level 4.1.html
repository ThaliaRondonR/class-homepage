      To a sad girl <br/>
      Uriah Hamilton<br/>
    </div>
    
    <div id="fade-one">
      There is no way to <span class="upright">explain</span> <br/>
      Unending sorrow and grief, <br/>
      No way to kiss a young girlâ€™s cheek <br/>
      In a way that would give her back <br/>
      The joy death has stolen. <br/>
    </div>

    <div id="fade-two">
    Humans are brave enough <br/>
To live and bleed and die, <br/> 
But to be the one remaining <br/>
As others say goodbye <br/>
Is too much to withstand. <br/>
    </div>

    <div id="fade-three">
      There are evil stars that smirk <br/>
      And thus mark us for treacherous fates, <br/>
      The days all burn like desert fields <br/>
      Until there is nothing left to love <br/>
      And nothing left to feel. <br/>
    </div>
